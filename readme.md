🛰️ Task 8: VPN Setup and Privacy Evaluation

📘 Overview

This task demonstrates how to use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to enhance online privacy, protect sensitive data, and secure communication over the Internet. By connecting to a VPN server through ProtonVPN, I verified encryption, IP masking, and network performance changes.

🎯 Objective

1. Understand how VPNs safeguard user data and identity.

2. Learn to set up and use a VPN client.

3. Verify the change in IP address and encrypted traffic.

4. Analyze the benefits and limitations of VPNs.

🧰 Tools Used
| Tool                         | Purpose                                              |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **ProtonVPN (Subscription)** | VPN connection and encryption testing                |
| **WhatIsMyIPAddress.com**    | To verify IP address before and after VPN connection |
| **Browser (Chrome/Firefox)** | For connection verification                          |
| **Speedtest.net**            | To compare browsing speed before and after VPN       |

🧭 Steps Followed

1. Logged into ProtonVPN account at https://account.protonvpn.com
.

2. Downloaded and installed the ProtonVPN desktop client.

3. Launched the application and signed in using my Proton credentials.

4. Connected to a VPN server (selected closest location: India or Singapore for better speed).

5. Verified IP address on WhatIsMyIPAddress.com
.

a. Before VPN: Displayed my actual ISP IP.

b. After VPN: IP changed to the VPN server location.

6. Browsed multiple websites to confirm stable and encrypted connection (HTTPS and VPN lock symbol visible).

7. Ran a speed test to compare browsing speed with and without VPN.

8. Disconnected VPN and observed IP reverted to normal ISP address.

   🧩 Findings and Observations:
   
   | Test                  | Before VPN             | After VPN                      |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| IP Address            | Local ISP IP           | Masked (VPN server IP)         |
| Location Shown        | Real geographic region | VPN server location            |
| Connection Encryption | Standard HTTPS         | Double encrypted (VPN + HTTPS) |
| Speed                 | ~95 Mbps               | ~80 Mbps (minor drop)          |
 
Observation: VPN successfully masked IP address and encrypted traffic. Slight speed drop observed due to encryption overhead — acceptable for enhanced privacy.

🧠 VPN Encryption and Privacy Features

1. Encryption: ProtonVPN uses AES-256-bit encryption with Secure Core architecture, ensuring high data security.

2. Protocols: Supports OpenVPN and WireGuard for secure communication.

3. No-Logs Policy: Ensures user activities are not tracked or stored.

4. Kill Switch: Protects users if VPN connection drops unexpectedly.

5. DNS Leak Protection: Prevents real IP from being revealed through DNS requests.
   
   🔒 Benefits of Using VPN

a. Hides real IP address and masks identity.

b. Encrypts internet traffic on public Wi-Fi networks.

c. Prevents ISP or attackers from tracking activity.

d. Bypasses geo-restrictions and censorship safely.

⚠️ Limitations

1. Slight reduction in internet speed due to encryption overhead.

2. Free servers may have limited bandwidth and locations.

3. VPN cannot prevent phishing or malware if user visits unsafe sites.

📸 Screenshot Description

a) Screenshot 1: ProtonVPN client connected to Singapore server (shows connection time and IP).

b) Screenshot 2: WhatIsMyIPAddress.com page displaying VPN IP.

c) Screenshot 3: Browser after disconnection showing original IP restored.

All screenshots confirm successful setup, encryption, and secure browsing session.

✅ Results

1. VPN setup completed successfully using ProtonVPN.

2. IP masking, encryption, and stable connection verified.

3. Demonstrated clear understanding of VPN’s role in secure communication and privacy.
